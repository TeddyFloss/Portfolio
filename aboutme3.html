    I'm a unconvincingly 16 year old transient. I rarely spent enough time on the things that are important, but reserve a wealth
  of time for playing uke by myself on sunny days (a possible reason for my vitamin d deficiency). I enjoy drawing, reading, traveling abroad,
  and spending inordinate amounts of time on very specific projects. My interest in coding centers primarily on robotics and game design, though graphic
  design also strikes my fancy. As can be gleaned from my writing, I enjoy utilizing my extensive vocabulary to make very simple things
  sound extrodinarily complicated. I believe in genies and dreams, but staunchly reject the existence of unicorns (it's simply too implausible).
