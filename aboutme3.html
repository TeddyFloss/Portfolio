<h1>别人是别人</h1>
 
  <h2>  <font face="papyrus">Sarah Wright</font></h2>

  <p><font face="papyrus">
    I'm a unconvincingly 16 year old transient. I rarely spent enough time on the things that are important, but reserve a wealth
  of time for playing uke by myself on sunny days (a possible reason for my vitamin d deficiency). I enjoy drawing, reading, traveling abroad,
  and spending inordinate amounts of time on very specific projects. My interest in coding centers primarily on robotics and game design, though graphic
  design also strikes my fancy. As can be gleaned from my writing, I enjoy utilizing my extensive vocabulary to make very simple things
  sound extrodinarily complicated. I believe in genies and dreams, but staunchly reject the existence of unicorns (it's simply too implausible).

  <h4>Reflections</h4>
  <p>style= "color:lightblue;"<font face="papyrus">My website has a simple color scheme that utlizes shades of pink and purple, which are more friendly to color blind users. The text is also a good size for who vision impairments.
    The website doesn't carry any heavy files that would cause difficulty for those with slower internet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="papyrus">I enjoyed the look of the templates others used.</font></p>
  <p><font face="papyrus">I'm proud of the aesthetics of my website</font></p>

  
  <h3>Core 4</h3>
    <h4>Variables</h4>
  <p><font face="papyrus">My text adventure contained many variables, including several to represent blocks of text and user inputs.</font></p>

    <h4>Loops</h4>
  <p><font face="papyrus">Loops are vital in simplyfying otherwise complicated and lengthy blocks of code in simpler sections of efficient code</font></p>

  <h4>Conditionals</h4>
  <p><font face="papyrus">Conditionals are vital in developing user interactions, I personally utlized several if statements in my attempt to develop a branching storyline</font></p>

  <h4>Function<h4>
    <p><font face="papyrus">For this code in particular I did not utilize any function as the type of program I was making didn't really benefit from then, however functions can simplify code.</font></p>
      
    <h2> Lists</h2>
    <p> Lists are an incredibly useful tool for storing large amounts of data in the same place in organized manner/p>
      <p>For the past two days I have worked in many groups and with several partners to learn about lists and how to utilize them in our code. The most productive group, however, was not a group but a partnership. 
I worked best with Hannah, who sits to my left, as we were able to eaily communicate and figure things out together</p>
